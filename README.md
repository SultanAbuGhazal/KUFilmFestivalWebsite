# KUFilmFestivalWebsite
This is one simple project that I had to deliver in February 2017. 
This website was requested and funded by the Theater and Talents Club in my University 
(of which I was a valuable member/cameraman/editor/director) to advertise a Film Festival. 
Through this website, filmmakers were able to fill and submit their application forms. 
There are two types of applications offered, one for individual registration, and the other for team registration. 
The website only targeted the university students and staff so it was decided to go with file storage rather than database storage. 
This increased the simplicity, and lowered the cost of the project, but most of all it did the job perfectly.
